# Soccer-Box-Code

All of the software to run different soccer games with pressure sensative-light up targets with the custom Smart Box soccer training technology I helped to create. The system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi that communicates with multiple Arduinos via SSH to run games in parallel. These games are currently in use for training athletes at The Soccer Box of Connecticut.
